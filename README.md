This is the first try of creating an youtube clone with the help of youtube tutorial from SuperSimpleDev; using only Html and  CSS this has turned out to something similar with what
I had as my primary homescreen video suggestion at the time of start of the project. 

This is simple front-end part of the youtube home page which takes you to the channel home page when clicked on channel name and profile and to the video when thumbnail or the 
video title is clicked; with the tooltips of respective header section buttons; although they are non-functional at this point of my learning but will try to make them responsive as well in near future.
Some subtle details include the change of the background colour when pointed to a button and change in color of the channel name when pointed on it.
The below preview screenshot is taken on the local device before public hosting of site using github.
